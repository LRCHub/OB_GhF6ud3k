[00:00.23] Marty! I just heard about your audition
[00:03.12] I am so sorry, Strickland is such a jerk!
[00:07.19] Hey, what if he's right, Jennifer?
[00:09.48] What if I'm just not cut out for music
[00:11.04] What if I never get a chance to play for an audience?
[00:13.76] Oh, come on, one rejection is not the end of the world
[00:17.65] And you're good Marty, you're really, really good
[00:21.94] What if today was a sign?
[00:24.30] I just don't think I can take anymore rejection
[00:29.36] Sorry to sound like my old man
[00:44.36] 
[00:32.72] Why do you let people put you down?
[00:37.27] It's not for them to say
[00:41.63] Just keep your feet planted on the ground
[00:46.08] And look the other way
[00:57.08] 
[00:50.71] They'll define you
[00:53.24] Unless you have a dream
[00:54.72] You gotta take time to
[00:57.81] Be what you can be
[00:59.26] And let me remind you
[01:01.86] You're everything to me
[01:05.35] Something good is flowing
[01:17.85] 
[01:07.31] Wherever we're going is alright with me
[01:11.67] There's no way of knowing
[01:13.73] We'll just wait and see
[01:16.09] We'll get where we're going eventually
[01:20.33] Wherever we're going is alright, alright, alright
[01:26.22] Alright with me
[01:33.72] 
[01:31.77] I know you better than anyone
[01:36.29] And you belong to me
[01:40.60] And we will finish what we've begun
[01:45.01] You'll write a song for me
[01:58.01] 
[01:49.42] I can hear it
[01:52.02] When you sing to me
[01:53.80] I wanna be near it
[01:56.39] It's you I wanna see
[01:58.26] Let me be clear that
[02:00.56] You're everything to me
[02:04.04] Something good is flowing
[02:16.54] 
[02:06.31] Wherever we're going is alright with me
[02:10.47] I'm loving just knowing
[02:12.61] You're going with me
[02:14.93] A future together is our destiny
[02:19.34] Wherever we're going is alright, alright
[02:24.04] It's alright
[02:30.04] 
[02:25.81] Wherever we're going, we're both gonna see
[02:30.26] Our story evolving (our story)
[02:32.48] A great mystery
[02:33.93] I know in my heart that we're holding the key
[02:38.86] Wherever we're going (wherever)
[02:41.16] Is alright (it's alright) alright (alright)
[02:43.69] It's alright (alright), it's alright
[02:45.92] It's alright
[02:51.92] 
[02:49.36] It's alright with me
